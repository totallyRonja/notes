## Lore

Miner (slave? clone??) from the Baronies. Part of the "Ungrateful", a terrorist organisation that fights the Baronies (and a lot can't stand union for being a part in all this shit).

Their chapter was ...disarmed... by being shipped to a remote planet (killing them would've angered union too much (or even exposed more serious stuff??)).

On the planet Kushaaneh took a leader role, making sure the community is productive - she also found a oold GMS mech on that planet she used for farming. 

Kushaaneh lived on said remote planet for multiple decades before HA landed there to strip it for resources. This time union *did* make an appearance though and told HA to fuck off because theres already humans there.

A little later Kushaaneh decided to give union a shot as a "tool" of helping ppl, but is still a bit sceptical about the motives and details about everything. She left the community behind in the leadership of her ex wife [[No√©mie]].
